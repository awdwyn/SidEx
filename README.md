SidEx Kerbal Space Program Mods

A small collection of my personal mods for Kerbal Space Program. 


# Full mods:

Project Manager: A complete rewrite of the original Project Manager (https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/159406-14-project-manager-group-and-autonumber-your-launches-09032018/) as it doesn't work with the new VesselNaming features. Mine does.

Science AI: Inspired by ASS (https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/95531-14x-automatedsciencesampler-v135-28042018/) but also a complete rewrite. Attaches to command modules (pods/probes) for the on/off switch and upgrades features based on R&D tech unlocks.

Self Destruct: Inspired by TAC Self Destruct (https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154232-151-tac-self-destruct-continued/) but less buggy in KSP 1.5+


# Little bits:

Surface Mount Probe: Just that, nothing complex.

Automated Kerbalism Lab: A lab that doesn't need kerbals in it to function. Requires Kerbalism.

Commdish 5-5: A smaller 88-88, with less range.

Miscellaneous ModuleManager patches.
